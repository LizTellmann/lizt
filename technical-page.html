        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          So, you have just learnt the basics of HTML and CSS. Let’s get to know how CSS is structured so we can build our dachshund blog website.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="main-section" id="How_CSS_is_structured">
        <h2>How CSS is structured</h2>
        
        <p>
          Let's examine the three methods of applying CSS to a document: with an external stylesheet, with an internal stylesheet, and with inline styles.
        </p>
        <h3>External stylesheet</h3>
        
        <p>
          An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document.
          You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet.
        </p>
        <h3>Internal stylesheet</h3>
        <p>An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a style element contained inside the
          HTML head.
        <p>
        
        <h3>Inline styles</h3>
        
        <p>
          Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a style attribute. The implementation of an inline style in an
          HTML document might look like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: Avoid using CSS in this way, when possible. It is the opposite of a best practice. First, it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for
          maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="main-section" id="Selectors">
        <h2>Selectors</h2>
        
        <p>
          A selector targets HTML to apply styles to content. If CSS is not applying to content as expected, your selector may not match the way you think it
          should match.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each CSS rule starts with a selector — or a list of selectors — in order to tell the browser which element or elements the rules should apply to. All
          the examples below are valid selectors or lists of selectors.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="main-section" id="Specificity">
        <h2>Specificity</h2>
        
        <p>
          You may encounter scenarios where two selectors select the same HTML element. Consider the stylesheet below, with a p selector that sets paragraph
          text to blue. However, there is also a class that sets the text of selected elements to red.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CSS language has rules to control which selector is stronger in the event of a conflict. These rules are called cascade and specificity. In the
          code block below, we define two rules for the p selector, but the paragraph text will be blue. This is because the declaration that sets the paragraph
          text to blue appears later in the stylesheet. Later styles replace conflicting styles that appear earlier in the stylesheet. This is the cascade rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rules of specificity and the cascade can seem complicated at first. These rules are easier to understand as you become more familiar with CSS. The
          Cascade and inheritance section in the next module explains this in detail, including how to calculate specificity.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="main-section" id="Properties_and_values">
        <h2>Properties and values</h2>
        
        <p>
          At its most basic level, CSS consists of two components:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Properties: These are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features you want to modify. For example, font-size, width,
            background-color.
          </li>
          <li>Values: Each property is assigned a value. This value indicates how to style the property.
            The example below highlights a single property and value. The property name is color and the value is blue.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p> When a property is paired with a value, this pairing is called a CSS declaration. CSS declarations are found within CSS Declaration Blocks. In the
          example below, highlighting identifies the CSS declaration block.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce CSS rule sets (or CSS rules). The example below contains two rules: one for the
          h1 selector and one for the p selector. The colored highlighting identifies the h1 rule.
        </p>
        <p> Setting CSS properties to specific values is the primary way of defining layout and styling for a document. The CSS engine calculates which
          declarations apply to every single element of a page.
        </p>
        <p>CSS properties and values are case-insensitive. The property and value in a property-value pair are separated by a colon (:).</p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        
        <p>
          While most values are relatively simple keywords or numeric values, there are some values that take the form of a function.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="main-section" id="@rules">
        <h2>@rules</h2>
        
        <p>
          CSS @rules (pronounced "at-rules") provide instruction for what CSS should perform or how it should behave. Some @rules are simple with just a keyword
          and a value. For example, @import imports a stylesheet into another CSS stylesheet:
        </p>
        <p>One common @rule that you are likely to encounter is @media, which is used to create media queries. Media queries use conditional logic for applying
          CSS styling.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="main-section" id="Code_Examples">
        <h2>Code Examples</h2>
        
        <p>
          Here are some examples of the CSS code mentioned above:
        </p>
        <p>
          styles.css:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
/*Create your test CSS here */
p {
  color: "red";
}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Making your CSS more specific:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;p class="special">what color am I&lt;/p&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          The calc() function:
        </p>
        <code>
          <span>
            <span><</span>
            "div"
          </span>
          <span>class</span>
          <span>
            <span>=</span>
            <span>"</span>
            "outer"
            <span>"</span>
          </span>
          <span>></span>
          <span>
            <span><</span>
            "div"
          </span>
          <span>class</span>
          <span>
            <span>=</span>
            <span>"</span>
            "box"
            <span>"</span>
          </span>
          <span>></span>
          <span>
            "The inner box is 90% - 30px."
          </span>
          "div"
        </code>
        
        <p>
          @rules importing a stylesheet
        </p>
        <code>
          <span>@import</span>
          <span>'style2.css'</span>
          <span>;</span>
        
        </code>
        
        <p>
          Shorthand examples:
        </p>
        <code>
          <span>background</span>
          <span>:</span>
          "red"
          <span>url</span>
          <span>(</span>
          "bg-graphic.png"
          <span>)</span>
          "10px 10px repeat-x fixed"
          <span>;</span>
        </code>
